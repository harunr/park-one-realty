                    <p>At Park One Realty, we want to see our agents receive as much of their hard earned commission as possible. That’s why we offer some of the most generous commission plans in the business. Not only are our commission plans generous, but we don’t charge all the miscellenous junk fees that some brokerages charge such as desk fees, technology fees, franchise fees, etc.</p>
                    <p>Our plans are simple and straight forward and allow you to take home more of the commission you work so hard to earn.</p>

                    <p>Recruit other good real estate agents to join Park One Realty and receive an immediate $250 bonus as soon as the agent signs on. In addition, you’ll also receive $250 for each of your recruited agent’s first 3 closings while at Park One Realty. This totals up to $1,000 for each agent you recruit. With some of the best commission plans around, and world class support and tools, recruiting other top agents to Park One Realty is a breeze.</p>
                    <p>Please Note: The reason we do not offer a commission sharing plan where agents receive a small percentage of their recruited agents’ commission is for privacy reasons. Commission sharing plans like this are based on the commission income of recruited agents, and we do not want to constantly make this sort of information available to their sponsoring agents. We feel it is better to keep this sort of information private.</p>
